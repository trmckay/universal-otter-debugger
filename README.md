# universal-otter-debugger

## About ##
This is an extension of another project of mine, a [debugger for RISC-V RV32I over USB UART](https://github.com/trmckay/riscv-uart-debugger/tree/dev). It is a module that translates generic debugger requests into specific signals for various architecures of Cal Poly's RISC-V implementation.

## Getting the files ##
Make sure to do a recursive clone, the client and most of the SystemVerilog code are in the submodules.
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:trmckay/universal-otter-debugger.git
```
To compile all the SystemVerilog code into one file, ```otter_debugger.sv```:
```
make module
```

## Installing the client ##

### From releases ###
Download the latest release, and keep the binary somewhere you can find it.

### Building from source (recommended) ###

You will need gcc, GNU make, glib, and readline.

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install gcc make readline-dev libglib2.0-dev
```

Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S gcc make lib32-readline glib2
```

Next, run the installer script:
```
cd uart-db/client
./INSTALL
```

## Implementing the module ##
Implementing the module for your Otter is very simple, as it uses standard Otter signals. In general, internal MCU signals should be used when ```db_active``` is low and debugger signals when it is high.

More detailed instructions are included in the releases in pdf format.

### Multicycle Otter ###

### Pipelined Otter ###
Instructions coming soon, see module.

## Client usage ##
Launch the tool with:
```
uart-db <device>
```
Or to autodetect ports, omit the device.

Your device is likely connected to ```/dev/ttyUSBX``` or ```/dev/ttySX```.
Once in the tool, type 'h' for more information.

You can add variables to ```~/.config/uart-db/config``` where the name comes first, followed by a space, then the value. Each name-value pair is separated by a newline. Values can be hex or decimal formatted. Example:
```
MY_DATA_ADDR 0x110C0000
A_GOOD_NUMBER 12
```
The file will be sourced when the program starts up.
